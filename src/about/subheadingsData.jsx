          <p>
            With a strong background in mining and mineral processing
            engineering, I transitioned into software development due to the
            lack of evolving opportunities within the mining industry. This
            shift ignited a passion for the ever-evolving world of technology
            and its potential to reshape industries.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now, with a focus in software development, I'm leveraging my
            problem-solving skills honed in engineering to tackle new challenges
            and create innovative solutions. I'm constantly seeking to expand my
            knowledge in web and software development.
            <br />
            <br />I also have expertise as a Virtual Assistant.

          <p>
            For 6 months, I thrived in a remote software development internship
            at a logistics company. I wore many hats, working on both the
            front-end and back-end to ensure the smooth operation of their
            integrated management system (IMS). This internship was an amazing
            learning experience, especially because I went in with no prior
            knowledge of Laravel, Vue.js, or GraphQL.

          <p>
            In addition to my client projects, I've been actively honing my
            skills by building web applications using VueJS, Laravel, and PHP.
            This allows me to stay current with the latest technologies and
            expand my full-stack development capabilities.
